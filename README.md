# Programming-Implementation-of-Cipher-Algorithms
Program will be based on a menu of options, where:

1. The user will input a cipher (e.g., a word, a phrase, or text) from the keyboard.
2. The user will select the algorithm.
3. The user will input the encryption key(s).
4. The program will display the cipher.
5. There will be an option to terminate the program.

## Available Algorithms:
- Caesar Cipher
- Vigenere
- Affine
- HILL
- Substitution Cipher
- OTP (One-Time Pad)
- RSA
